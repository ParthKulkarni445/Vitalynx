# Vitalynx : Electronic Health Records (EHR) using Blockchain

This project is a basic implementation of a blockchain-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, developed to illustrate how blockchain technology can be applied to securely manage patient records. The system provides an interactive menu with options to:

- Register a new patient
- Add medical records
- View existing records
- View existing blocks
- Testing Blockchain Immutability 

## Key Features

- **Secure, Decentralized Storage**: Patient records are distributed across nodes, reducing risks of breaches and data loss.
- **Immutable Records**: Each record is permanent and cannot be altered once added.
- **Privacy and Access Control**: Only authorized users can access records, maintaining data confidentiality.
- **Auditability**: Every update is logged, creating a transparent history of changes.

Each patient record is securely stored in the blockchain, ensuring that data remains private, tamper-proof, and transparent. Users must have valid authorization to access records, and all actions are logged securely within the blockchain. 

## Compile and Run

- **Compile**: To compile this project, ensure to have the C compiler installed. Its the only dependency for the project.
- **Input**: Our user-friendly menu driven interface will guide you to input fields required at that time. Otherwise, you need to input the integer corresponding to thhe desired option.
- **Output**: The output will be shown in the terminal itself.
